"""Schema parity: fresh installs vs upgraded databases.

DockMon builds its schema through two different pipelines:

- Fresh install: migrate.py _handle_fresh_install -> Base.metadata.create_all()
  + stamp HEAD (no migrations execute).
- Upgrade: migrate.py runs the Alembic chain (oldest supported baseline is a
  v1.1.3 database; migration 001 ALTERs those tables rather than creating them).

Both are followed by the DatabaseManager startup pass (create_all for missing
model tables + its ad-hoc column migrations), which is part of the production
pipeline and therefore part of what these tests build.

If a table or column exists in only one pipeline, one class of user gets a
broken schema. That is exactly how fresh v2.4.x installs shipped without the
stats history tables: migration 037 created tables that deliberately have no
ORM model (the Go stats-service owns them), so create_all() never made them
and stats-service silently disabled itself.

These tests fail on any new table/column divergence, and additionally enforce
full definitional parity (types, nullability, defaults, uniques, foreign keys)
for the Go-owned stats history tables. Known historical leftovers that only
exist on upgraded databases are frozen in LEGACY_UPGRADED_ONLY_COLUMNS below;
do not add entries for new code.
