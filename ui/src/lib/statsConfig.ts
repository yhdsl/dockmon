// NOTE: gap-detection is deliberately NOT implemented here. The earlier draft
// had a `detectGaps()` helper, but with no consumers in this commit it was
// just dead code carrying a latent unit-mismatch footgun (it wanted `t` in
// milliseconds while MiniChart wants unix seconds). It will be reintroduced
// alongside the first real consumer, where the unit contract can be enforced
// end-to-end rather than via a JSDoc warning.
